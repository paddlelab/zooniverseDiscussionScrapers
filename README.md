# Discussion Scrapers

This repository contains scraper scripts that allow data to be recursively extracted from discussion forums such as Google Groups and those that are part of Zooniverse citizen science projects.

## Requirements
<a href="https://github.com/martinsbalodis/web-scraper-chrome-extension">Web Scraper Chrome Extension</a>

## Use
Open Google Chrome and navigate to the discussion forum you would like to extract. View developer tools and open the Web Scraper tab. Create a new sitemap by importing a sitemap. Add the appropriate script making sure to update the initial URL to fit the forum you want to scrape.

These scraper scripts were developed as part of the <a href="http://citizenscience.blogg.gu.se">Mobilising Citizens in Science (MobCitSci)</a> research project at the University of Gothenburg.
